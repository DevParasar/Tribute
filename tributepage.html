      Dr. Kalam was a visonary, a scientist, the President of a countryand a
      great human being. From satellites to local healthcare, his contributions
      will always be worthy of mention when we talk of science and technology in
      India.

    <h3 id="headline">Here's a brief life and history of Dr. Kalam's life:</h3>
    <p>
      Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam (15 October 1931 â€“ 27 July 2015) was
      an aerospace scientist who served as the 11th President of India from 2002
      to 2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied
      physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a
      scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and
      Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation
      (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and
      military missile development efforts. He thus came to be known as the
      Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile
      and launch vehicle technology. He also played a pivotal organisational,
      technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998,
      the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.
    </p>

    <p>
      Kalam was elected as the 11th President of India in 2002 with the support
      of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian
      National Congress. Widely referred to as the "People's President", he
      returned to his civilian life of education, writing and public service
      after a single term. He was a recipient of several prestigious awards,
      including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour.
    </p>

    <p>
      While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong,
      Kalam collapsed and died from an apparent cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015,
      aged 83. Thousands including national-level dignitaries attended the
      funeral ceremony held in his hometown of Rameshwaram, where he was buried
      with full state honours.

          >He was the Project Director in ISRO to help develop India's first
          indigenous Satellite Launch Vehicle</strong
        >
        At a time when India had hardly dreamt of its own Satellite Launch
        Vehicle (SLV), Dr. Kalam's efforts and hard work for over a decade, made
        it possible for us to develop our first indigenous SLV. SLV III injected
        Rohini satellite in the near earth orbit in July 1980 making India an
        exclusive Space Club member.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong
          >He also became the Project Director for two missile projects whose
          aim was to develop ballistic missiles from the technology of the
          successful SLV programme.</strong
        >
        After the success of the SLV programme, Dr. Kalam also became the
        director of two projects, Project Devil and Project Valiant. In the
        1970s, the goal of Project Devil was to produce a short-range
        surface-to-air missile. Although discontinued in 1980 without achieving
        full success, Project Devil, led to the later development of the Prithvi
        missile.

        <strong
          >He took up the responsibility of developing Indigenous Guided
          Missiles at DRDO.</strong
        >
        After working for two decades in ISRO, Dr. Kalam was appointed as the
        CEO of Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme (IGMDP). He was
        responsible for the development and operationalisation of AGNI and
        PRITHVI missiles.<strong
          >This also earned him the title of 'Missile Man of India'.</strong
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong
          >He was the brain behind multiple nuclear tests carried out at Pokhran
          in 1998 which made India a nuclear weapon state.</strong
        >
        Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam was the Scientific Adviser to the Defence Minister
        of India between 1992 and 1999 when India went ahead with the nuclear
        explosions at Pokhran. He supervised the Pokhran II explosions as the
        CEO of DRDO. While camping in the Thar desert for over a fortnight, he
        said: "The testing was a 'defining moment' in the country's history,
        next only to adopting the path of economic liberalisation in 1991."

      <li>
        <strong
          >He helped design a cost-effective coronary stent known as
          'Kalam-Raju-Stent' making healthcare accessible to all.</strong
        >
        Dr. Kalam collaborated with cardiologist B. Soma Raju for the
        development of the famed 'Kalam-Raju-Stent' for coronary heart disease.
        The device was introduced in the market in 1994, and led to reduction of
        prices of imported coronary stents in India by more than 50 percent. The
        upgraded models of this stent are now available in the market.

        <strong
          >He was deeply involved in the country's Light Combat Aircraft
          project</strong
        >
        Since passing out of the Madras Institute of Technology where he
        specialised in Aeronautical Engineering, President Kalam had been
        associated with avionics. In particular, he was deeply involved with the
        country's Light Combat Aircraft project. He also became the first Indian
        Head of State to fly a fighter plane.

        <strong
          >Dr. Kalam and Dr. Soma Raju, came up with a rugged tablet computer in
          2012 to take care of the health of underprivileged people in rural
          India.</strong
        >
        After the success of Kalam- Raju, he along with the cardiologist, Soma
        Raju developed a tablet that was aimed at arming healthcare workers at
        the primary level to respond to emergency medical situations.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          He was the driving force behind the development of lightweight
          callipers for patients with motor disabilities.</strong
        >
        While India has been declared polio free by the WHO, back in 1995 and
        1996, Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam and his team worked endlessly to produce
        orthosis callipers that weighed 1/10th of the weight of those that were
        available in the market. These floor reaction calipers made movement and
        walking less painful and cumbersome, allowing kids to walk more freely
        and fluidly without much help.
